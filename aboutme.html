<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
<body> played hockey practically my entire life. 19 years to be exact. I played the majority of my career with the Columbia Valley Rockies, Selkirk Saints, Portage Voyageurs.</body>
<br>
<h2>Columbia Valley Rockies</h2>
    <p>I played in Columbia Valley for three years. It was a great experience! Columbia Valley is a hockey team out of Invermere, BC.</p>
    <br>
<h2>Selkirk Saints</h2>
    <p>After playing three years in Invermere I was fortunate enough to get a hockey scholarship with the Selkirk Saints. The Saints are based out of Castlegar, BC. I really fell in love with town, beautiful views, and endless places to hike.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Portage Voyageurs</h2>
    <p>I then decided to take a scholarship with the Portage Voyageurs located in Lac La Biche, AB. Which was an okay experience. I ended up playing there for a year and then went back to Selkirk.</p>
