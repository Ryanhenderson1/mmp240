<h2>About Me</h2>
<body>
 played hockey practically my entire life. 19 years to be exact. I played the majority of my career with the Columbia Valley Rockies, Selkirk Saints, Portage Voyageurs.</body>
<br>
<h2>Columbia Valley Rockies</h2>
    <p>I played in Columbia Valley for three years. It was a great experience! Columbia Valley is a hockey team out of Invermere, BC.</p>
    <br>
<h2>Selkirk Saints</h2>
    <p>After playing three years in Invermere I was fortunate enough to get a hockey scholarship with the Selkirk Saints. The Saints are based out of Castlegar, BC. I really fell in love with town, beautiful views, and endless places to hike.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Portage Voyageurs</h2>
        <style>
   p {
    font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
}I then decided to take a scholarship with the Portage Voyageurs located in Lac La Biche, AB. Which was an okay experience. I ended up playing there for a year and then went back to Selkirk.

        <h2>Why I chose this layout</h2>
        <p>I decided to not change my layout too much, I think that the layout looked alright. That and CSS is not working the best for me, some css codes are screwing up the HTML ones.</p>
